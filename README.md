# liri-node-app
Axios - API calls in Node
Because this is a CLI App, it cannot be deployed to GitHub pages or Heroku. So I have included screenshots, and or a GIF, and or a video showing us that I have the app working with no bugs. 

Following, is information as it relates to the application(s)

What is it doing and why - Liri takes in commands then disseminates information using API calls. A response is returned and with the information formatted based on user (classroom) requirements
