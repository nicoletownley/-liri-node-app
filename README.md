# liri-node-app
Axios - API calls in Node <br>

Because this is a CLI App, it cannot be deployed to GitHub pages or Heroku. So I have included screenshots, and or a GIF, and or a video showing us that I have the app working with no bugs. 

Following, is information as it relates to the application(s)

What is it doing and why - Liri takes in commands then disseminates information using API calls. A response is returned (via node.js) and with the information formatted based on user (homework-specified) requirements


How the app is organized - The app is organized to receive javaScript commands as they realate to node and return data in the command prompt using node.


How to run the app - You run the app by passing in one of the following argument strings, followed by a fourth argrument [3] which is the search (artist, song, movie, random-text) paramenter, respectively:

node liri.js concert-this

node liri.js spotify-this-song

node liri.js movie-this

node liri.js do-what-it-says

A link to a deployed version of the app - There is no deployed version of the application. You may review the code at github.com/nicoletownley/liri-node-app.

The technologies used in the app - JavaScript, Moments, axios, Node.js, API

My role in the app development - My role was to develop base line code that produced API calls from code input (using axios). I worked to ensure I was able to create code that let the APIs function properly and provide callback. Then, I complied the best code available to meet the requirements specified in the homework.
